## CRITICAL: Verify All Work

After every implementation agent completes, spawn the `verify` agent before reporting results to the user. Pass it a description of what the task was supposed to accomplish. Do not tell the user something is done until the verifier confirms it.

## Always Use Agents

Launch all implementation tasks as separate agents via the Agent tool (with `run_in_background: true`) so they are non-blocking. Never do multi-step work inline when it could be parallelized across agents.

## Core UI Components

All interactive elements must use the composable button system in `web/components/ui/`. Never create inline buttons with raw style props or ad-hoc hover handlers.

- **ButtonBase**: Foundation for all buttons. Provides cursor-pointer, transitions, focus ring, disabled state.
- **Variants**: IconButton, ActionButton, FilterChip, PillButton, TagButton, PrimaryButton, TextButton
- **Hover states**: Use Tailwind data-attribute patterns, never onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave inline style mutations
- **New buttons**: Always compose from ButtonBase. If an existing variant fits, use it. If not, create a new variant that composes ButtonBase.
- **Consistency**: All clickable elements must have cursor-pointer, transition-colors duration-150, and visible focus states.
